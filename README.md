# Airbnb-Revenue-Decline-Project


### **Project Objective**

* Investigate the decline in Airbnb revenue across New York listings.
* Identify key business and user behavior patterns affecting performance.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve pricing strategy, host performance, and customer experience.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**

* **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis (Pandas, NumPy), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **MySQL**: Data storage, querying, and preprocessing
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data analysis and code documentation
* **Power BI** (if applicable): Interactive dashboards and visual reporting
* **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project documentation

---

### **Techniques and Concepts Applied**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Root Cause Analysis
* Log Transformation
* Hypothesis Testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA)
* Outlier Detection and Treatment
* Data Grouping and Aggregation
* Categorical Feature Engineering (e.g., review categories, host types)
* Statistical Visualization for insight communication

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection and Storage**

   * Loaded the Airbnb NYC dataset (\~50,000+ rows) into MySQL for structured storage and easy querying.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

   * Identified and handled missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data types.
   * Detected and treated outliers in key features such as price and windspeed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Analyzed trends in pricing, booking frequency, host availability, and review patterns.
   * Generated summary statistics and correlation matrices to identify important relationships.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**

   * Conducted statistical tests to evaluate the significance of assumptions (e.g., impact of host type or availability on revenue).
   * Used test results to support or reject business hypotheses.

5. **Root Cause Analysis**

   * Investigated underlying factors contributing to the revenue decline.
   * Segmented data by season, host type, listing category, and review scores to isolate problem areas.

6. **Insight Generation and Recommendations**

   * Identified low-performing hosts, underbooked seasons, and overpricing as key drivers of revenue decline.
   * Proposed data-backed recommendations for improving pricing strategies and boosting host engagement.

7. **Visualization and Reporting**

   * Created detailed plots using Python to support insights.
   * (Optional) Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to present findings clearly to stakeholders.
